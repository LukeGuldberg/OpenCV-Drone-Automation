goodfeaturestotrack func
^^ try to implement, file only captures one frame so add it to webcam.cpp
once working, weed out some points that do not hang around when the camera moves
save points that still show after movement - research is goofeaturestotrack has a way of weeding out...
look into storing points in a queue to keep x amount of points inside at once. maintain the size of how many points we save



create a set from the vectors, this doesnt track duplicates 
do good features
then calcopticalflow
create a set between p0 and p1
save set for next loop iteration

good_new becomes oldcorners
do goodfeatures and then add that to oldcorners

how do I a float2f < float2f

add a class that implements a data structure that allows easy use for erasing points

implement the updated hashtable, the hash function, and also use a set to reuse points from frame to frame. Set a maxnum and whenever status[] gets below around 20 (status being the points chosen from opticalflow), add 30 more good features to the set to put us back at 50 points
