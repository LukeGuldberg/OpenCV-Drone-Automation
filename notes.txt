goodfeaturestotrack func
^^ try to implement, file only captures one frame so add it to webcam.cpp
once working, weed out some points that do not hang around when the camera moves
save points that still show after movement - research is goofeaturestotrack has a way of weeding out...
look into storing points in a queue to keep x amount of points inside at once. maintain the size of how many points we save
